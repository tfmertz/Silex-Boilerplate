# Silex/Twig Boilerplate

##### Description

A repo I made to quickly get a Silex application up and running. Dependencies are NOT included to provide flexibility in development. Edit your composer.json and `composer install` to get any dependencies you need.

##### Setup

1. `git clone` the repository
2. Update the composer.json file to include any dependencies you need
3. Run a composer install
4. Start a server in the web folder
5. Connecting to the localhost successfully will display a message

**NOTE** composer install is required for the project to run!

Enjoy!
